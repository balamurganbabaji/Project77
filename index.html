        <h1>Introduction to console screen.</h1>
   <p>The Visual Studio IDE (integrated development environment) is a software program for developers to write and edit their code. Its user interface is used for software development to edit, debug and build code.</p>
   <p>A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a console, the term most often refers to a system used to control one or more servers.</p>
